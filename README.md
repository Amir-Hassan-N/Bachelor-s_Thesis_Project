# 🌱 Analysis & Forecasting of Carbon Footprint Generated by MUET

## An AI-Powered Web Application for Sustainability
## 🎓 Bachelor of Software Engineering Engineering Thesis – Mehran University of Engineeting & Technology 

## 📌 Overview
This project presents the development of a web-based AI-integrated application to analyze and forecast the carbon footprint generated by Mehran University of Engineering & Technology (MUET). With rising environmental concerns, this system helps institutions track emissions from electricity, transport, events, and other sources, while providing actionable insights and forecasts to support green campus initiatives.

The goal is to make carbon data accessible, actionable, and impactful—contributing to sustainable development and climate awareness at the university level.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
✦ Accurately calculate MUET’s carbon footprint across multiple sources

✦ Identify major emission contributors (e.g., events, travel, electricity)

✦ Forecast emissions for the next 5 years using machine learning (linear regression)

✦ Provide real-time web access for students, faculty, and admin

✦ Suggest reduction strategies to move toward a greener campus
